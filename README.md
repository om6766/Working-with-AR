Before opening this project make sure you have unity and vuforia integrated in it,which you can download from vuforia official site.
You can create account of vuforia in developers section and can get your own key and target images.
In this project I have used four books to scan(Programming in ANSI,The complete java Reference,etc),so when you scan book using our app apk file you can view the reviews, we have put an imaginary button at the bottom of book so if you tap at bottom of book you we see index and futher more details of that book.
Main purpose is to comapre more than one items at a time.
